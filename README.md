## Installation
- Make sure install dependency management package for react ```yarn install```
- If you react router dom out of date, do ```yarn add react-router-dom@next```
- Navigate to src/app in terminal, and do ```yarn start``` to display FE
- Open the folder you just pull from Github, and click the start spring button to start BE server
- You need to setup the server too, I'm using MAMP, if you want to see the database just use the one that you prefer to see how backend data is being stored.  I won't go over the details here I believe everyone know how to set this up.
- For the rest of the part, how to startup Spring Boot and React app include testing with signup page till activation link and how redirect features works just follow the video
